# LIV for Boneworks

Mod that adds [**LIV**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/755540/LIV/) support to Boneworks. With it, you can use mixed reality capture (video where you have your real body inserted into the game), avatars (custom 3D avatars with a dynamic camera that can be in third person, while you play the game normally in first person), smoothed first person view, and more.
