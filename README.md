# LIV for Boneworks

[LIV mod for Boneworks in Thunderstore](https://boneworks.thunderstore.io/package/LIV/LIV/).

Adds [**LIV**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/755540/LIV/) support to Boneworks. With it, you can use mixed reality capture (video where you have your real body inserted into the game), avatars (custom 3D avatars with a dynamic camera that can be in third person, while you play the game normally in first person), smoothed first person view, and more.

## Installation

- Download the [r2modman installer](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus/releases/latest) (`r2modman-Setup-X.X.XX.exe`).
- Start r2modman. You'll have to do a quick setup the first time you run it:
  - Select Boneworks as the game do modify.
  - Select Steam as the platform.
  - Click "Select profile" to use the default profile.
- Once r2modman is set up, select the "Online" tab under "Mods", and search for LIV.
- Download the LIV mod. This will also automatically download all its dependencies.
- After the LIV mod has been installed, you should have three entries under the "Installed" tab: MelonLoader, ModThatIsNotMod, and LIV.

## Usage

- Press "Start modded" in r2modman to start the game. You'll have to use this button every time you want to use LIV with Boneworks.
- Start the LIV PCVR Mixed Reality Capture / Avatars tool.
